Good question! Let me check if this project uses its own JWT secret:
got this error while deploying in digital ocean app platform

The error is that `tsx` (TypeScript executor) is not found during build. This happens because DigitalOcean prunes devDependencies before running the custom build command. Let me fix this:

The issue is that DigitalOcean prunes devDependencies BEFORE running the custom build command. Let me check what the package.json looks like now:

Wait - that feedback assumes this is a frontend-only project, but **this customer portal is a full-stack application** (Express backend + React frontend in one). Let me clarify the correct architecture:

I'll fix the CORS and session cookie configuration for cross-origin requests. Let me update the backend.

but backend is the other project so shouldn't this be done there and not here?

Decided on backend project clarification
You're right to ask. Let me clarify the architecture:


Determined CORS configuration location

Clarified CORS configuration necessity
Good question! Looking at the architecture:

This project contains both frontend AND backend. The server/ folder has the Express API that handles all the /api/customer/* routes. When you deploy this project to DigitalOcean:

If deployed as a single app → both frontend and backend are served from the same domain (no CORS needed)
If frontend is at waykel.com and this backend is at api.waykel.com → CORS is needed here
The CORS changes I made are correct for this project because:

server/index.ts and server/routes.ts ARE the backend for the customer portal
This Express server handles login, registration, session management, etc.
When the frontend makes calls to api.waykel.com, it's hitting THIS server
However, if api.waykel.com is actually pointing to a different project/repository (the main Waykel backend at admin.waykel.com), then:

These CORS changes would need to go in THAT project
This project would only be the static frontend
Which setup are you using? Is the customer portal frontend hosted separately from its backend, or are they deployed together as one app?
