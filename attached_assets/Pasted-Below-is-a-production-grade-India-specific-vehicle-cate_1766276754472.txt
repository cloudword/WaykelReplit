Below is a production-grade, India-specific vehicle category & vehicle list, aligned with Indian logistics norms (RTO / GST / market usage) and what platforms like Porter, BlackBuck, Delhivery Freight, etc. use.

I’m structuring this in layers so it’s easy to implement in DB + UI + pricing logic.

1️⃣ Vehicle Category (Top-level)

These are fixed enums. Do NOT allow free text.

🚚 VEHICLE_CATEGORIES (India)

Two Wheeler

Three Wheeler

Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV)

Medium Commercial Vehicle (MCV)

Heavy Commercial Vehicle (HCV)

Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)

2️⃣ Vehicle Types / Listings (Under Each Category)

This is the complete practical list for Indian geo.

1️⃣ Two Wheeler

Used for documents, parcels, hyperlocal delivery.

Vehicle Type	Payload Capacity
Bike / Scooter	Up to 40 kg
2️⃣ Three Wheeler (Auto / Small Load)

Used heavily in urban & semi-urban logistics.

Vehicle Type	Payload
Cargo Auto	500 – 700 kg
E-Rickshaw (Cargo)	300 – 500 kg
3️⃣ Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV)

Most common category.

Vehicle Type	Typical Payload
Tata Ace / Chota Hathi	750 kg
Mahindra Jeeto	600 kg
Ashok Leyland Dost	1 – 1.25 ton
Pickup 407 (Closed/Open)	1.5 – 2.5 ton
Bolero Pickup	1.5 ton
4️⃣ Medium Commercial Vehicle (MCV)

Used for intercity and bulk movement.

Vehicle Type	Payload
Eicher 14 ft	3 – 4 ton
Eicher 17 ft	4 – 5 ton
Eicher 19 ft	5 – 7 ton
Tata 1109 / 709	3 – 5 ton
5️⃣ Heavy Commercial Vehicle (HCV)

Long-haul freight.

Vehicle Type	Payload
20 ft Container	6 – 7 ton
22 ft Container	7 – 8 ton
24 ft Container	8 – 10 ton
32 ft Single Axle	7 – 8 ton
32 ft Multi Axle	15 – 18 ton
Trailer (40 ft)	20 – 25 ton
6️⃣ Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)

Optional but important for scale.

Vehicle Type	Use Case
Refrigerated Truck	Cold chain
Tanker	Liquid transport
Car Carrier	Vehicle transport
Tipper / Dumper	Construction
Flatbed Truck	Machinery
Crane / Hydra	Heavy lifting
3️⃣ Body Type (Independent Dimension – VERY IMPORTANT)

Do NOT mix body type with vehicle type.

BODY_TYPES

Open

Closed / Box

Container

Flatbed

Refrigerated

Tanker

This allows:

Same vehicle (14 ft) to have multiple body options

Cleaner pricing rules

4️⃣ Vehicle Length (Standardized)

Use fixed selectable options.

Length Label	Approx
8 ft	Mini pickup
10 ft	Tata Ace
14 ft	407 / Eicher
17 ft	MCV
19 ft	MCV
22 ft	Container
24 ft	Container
32 ft	HCV
40 ft	Trailer
5️⃣ Axle Type (Required for pricing)
AXLE_TYPES

Single Axle

Multi Axle

6️⃣ Fuel Type (Optional but useful)

Diesel

Petrol

CNG

Electric

7️⃣ How this should appear in UI (IMPORTANT)
Transporter – Add Vehicle Flow

Step 1

Vehicle Category (dropdown)

Step 2

Vehicle Type (filtered by category)

Step 3

Body Type

Vehicle Length

Axle Type

Step 4

RC Upload (mandatory)

Customer – Book Trip Flow

Customer should see friendly labels, not technical ones.

Example:

“14 ft Closed Truck (3–4 Tons)”

Under the hood:

{
  "category": "LCV",
  "vehicle_type": "Eicher 14 ft",
  "body_type": "Closed",
  "payload_capacity": 4000
}

8️⃣ Database Design (Recommended)
vehicle_categories
id | name | code

vehicle_types
id
category_id
name
min_payload
max_payload
default_length

body_types
id | name

vehicles
vehicle_type_id
body_type_id
length_ft
axle_type
fuel_type

9️⃣ Enforcement Rules (Critical)

Transporter can select only from predefined lists

Customer can only book from enabled vehicle types

Pricing engine maps strictly to vehicle_type + body_type + length

10️⃣ Why this list works for Waykel

✔ Covers 95% Indian freight use cases
✔ Scales from hyperlocal → long-haul
✔ Prevents data inconsistency
✔ Enables pricing automation
✔ Works for B2B & SME customers

11️⃣ Final Recommendation (LOCK THIS)

Freeze categories & vehicle types

Allow admin-only addition in future

Never allow free-text vehicle entry
